## [11.0.0](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/compare/flutter_secure_storage-v10.3.1...flutter_secure_storage-v11.0.0) (2026-08-06)

**Breaking changes**

items deprecated in v10 have been removed. 
Any data saved using deprecated algorithms or features will be unusable after this upgrade. If you used a version prior to v10, upgrade to v10 first so existing data is migrated.

### Android

- Removed `KeyCipherAlgorithm.RSA_ECB_PKCS1Padding`. Upgrade to v10 first so existing data is migrated to `RSA_ECB_OAEPwithSHA_256andMGF1Padding` before upgrading to v11.
- Removed `StorageCipherAlgorithm.AES_CBC_PKCS7Padding`. Upgrade to v10 first so existing data is migrated to `AES_GCM_NoPadding` before upgrading to v11.
- Removed `encryptedSharedPreferences` parameter from `AndroidOptions` and `AndroidOptions.biometric`. The Jetpack Security (EncryptedSharedPreferences) backend is no longer supported; any remaining data was automatically migrated to custom cipher storage in v10.
- Removed `sharedPreferencesName` from `AndroidOptions`. Use `storageNamespace` instead for full namespace isolation.
- Raised `minSdk` to 24 and `compileSdk` to 37. Flutter 3.35 raised its own Android minimum to API 24, making API 23 support unverifiable with any supported Flutter version. The legacy AES-CBC cipher path that supported API 21-22 has been removed.

### Features

* **android:** add requireBiometricConfirmation option to AndroidOptions ([7f5f7de](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/commit/7f5f7de0ea98a6482c02e768faf7c82c2e5b959b))


### Bug Fixes

* **android:** catch Throwable on worker thread so keystore Errors don't crash the app ([d5802ff](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/commit/d5802ff6b422a391501145d1113ca9da4c39f1f0))
* **android:** don't swallow VM errors, catch Throwable on biometric thread too ([d413d3f](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/commit/d413d3fb2e8c0faaf78f986be9300e5f1ca6105c))
* **linux:** handle missing default keyring ([b39c7c1](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/commit/b39c7c1db6c1fe651367031c9d0033d590784de0))
* **linux:** fail closed on orphaned keyring data ([2e720ff](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/commit/2e720ff7e6b956a5d1197a5077bb8be39a5d5632))
* remove redundant ./ prefix from part directives ([cc7018d](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/commit/cc7018d15eae56b389348d73f788ae1a03c606c6))

## 10.3.1

### Android
- Fixed `AEADBadTagException` when biometric authentication is cancelled on first launch: a stale IV is now cleared and the cipher re-initialised in encrypt mode so the next authentication attempt succeeds.
- Fixed `NullPointerException` when retrying an operation after a cancelled biometric prompt: `preferences` is now only assigned once cipher initialisation completes successfully, allowing a clean retry.

## 10.3.0

### Android
- Added `AndroidBiometricType` enum and `biometricType` option to `AndroidOptions` to control which authentication methods are accepted during biometric prompts (requires `KeyCipherAlgorithm.AES_GCM_NoPadding`).
  - `AndroidBiometricType.biometricOrDeviceCredential` (default) accepts Class 3 biometrics or device credentials (PIN/pattern/password), preserving previous behaviour.
  - `AndroidBiometricType.strongBiometricOnly` restricts authentication to Class 3 (strong) biometrics only; device credentials are explicitly rejected.
- Fully enforced on Android 11+ (API 30+) via `setAllowedAuthenticators` on `BiometricPrompt` and `setUserAuthenticationParameters` on the KeyStore key. On earlier API levels the system may still permit device credentials.
- Added `biometricPromptNegativeButton` option to `AndroidOptions` to customise the dismiss button label on the biometric prompt. Required when using `strongBiometricOnly` or on Android 10 and lower.

### iOS / macOS
- Fixed `secStoreAvailabilitySink` not being called when protected data availability changes.
- Fixed `kSecUseDataProtectionKeychain` being added to Keychain queries unconditionally; it is now only set when `useDataProtectionKeychain` is explicitly enabled.

### Windows
- Fixed `deleteAll` and `containsKey` not acquiring the mutex lock, which could cause data races under concurrent access.
  If you are on Dart >=3.10.0, this fix is applied automatically. Otherwise, pin `flutter_secure_storage_windows: ^4.2.2` in your `pubspec.yaml` to opt in and make sure your constraint is set for minimum of Dart >=3.10.0.

### Linux
- Fixed `deleteKeyring` storing the string `"null"` instead of an empty JSON object `{}`.
- Fixed non-UTF-8 error messages from libsecret causing a `FormatException` on the Dart side; messages are now sanitised before being sent through the method channel.
- Fixed locked or unavailable keyring now surfacing as a catchable `PlatformException` with code `KeyringLocked`.
- Fixed JSON parse errors and other C++ exceptions now surfacing as a `PlatformException` with code `StorageError` instead of sending malformed bytes through the channel.
## 10.2.0

### Android
- Deprecated `KeyCipherAlgorithm.RSA_ECB_PKCS1Padding`. Existing data is automatically migrated to the default `RSA_ECB_OAEPwithSHA_256andMGF1Padding` when `migrateOnAlgorithmChange` is true.
- Deprecated `StorageCipherAlgorithm.AES_CBC_PKCS7Padding`. Existing data is automatically migrated to the default `AES_GCM_NoPadding` when `migrateOnAlgorithmChange` is true.
- Fixed Gradle space-assignment warnings in `build.gradle`.

### iOS / macOS
- Fixed iOS build by updating availability annotation for Secure Enclave methods from `iOS 11.3` to `iOS 13.0`.

### Windows
- Fixed compatibility with `win32` 6.0.0 in `flutter_secure_storage_windows 4.2.0`.
  If you are on Dart >=3.10.0, this fix is applied automatically. Otherwise, pin `flutter_secure_storage_windows: ^4.2.0` in your `pubspec.yaml` to opt in and make sure your constraint is set for minimum of Dart >=3.10.0.

## 10.1.0

### Windows
- Updated `flutter_secure_storage_windows` to 4.2.0 with compatibility fixes for `win32` 6.0.0.

### Android
- Added `storageNamespace` option to `AndroidOptions` for full namespace isolation across storage instances (SharedPreferences, KeyStore aliases, config/key storage). Use this instead of `sharedPreferencesName` when running multiple `FlutterSecureStorage` instances with different cipher configurations.
- Deprecated `sharedPreferencesName` in favor of `storageNamespace`, which provides complete isolation rather than data-only isolation.
- Added `migrateWithBackup` option to `AndroidOptions` for crash-resistant migration. When enabled, backup copies of encrypted data are created before migration starts, allowing recovery if migration fails or the app crashes mid-migration. Works in conjunction with `migrateOnAlgorithmChange`.
- Made `KeyCipherAlgorithm` and `StorageCipherAlgorithm` public enums.

**Fixes:**
- Fixed crash on biometric failure (not error).
- Fixed null safety issue in `MethodRunner` that could cause a crash on Android.
- Fixed config being overwritten on initialization.
- Fixed default Android key cipher not aligning with the Flutter default.

### iOS / macOS
- Added `useSecureEnclave` option to `IOSOptions` and `MacOsOptions` to store keys in the device's Secure Enclave for hardware-backed security.

**Fixes:**
- Fixed `kSecAttrSynchronizable` being silently dropped when no access control flags are set.
- Fixed `readAll` not returning Secure Enclave items correctly.

## 10.0.0
This major release brings significant security improvements, platform updates, and modernization across all supported platforms.

### Android
Due to the deprecation of Jetpack Security library, the Android implementation has been largely rewritten with custom secure ciphers, enhanced biometrics support, and migration tools.

**Breaking Changes:**
- `AndroidOptions().encryptedSharedPreferences` is now deprecated due to Jetpack Crypto package deprecation
  - Migration will automatically happen due to `migrateOnAlgorithmChange: true`, which can also be set to false if not wanted.
- ResetOnError will now automatically be true, because most errors are unrecoverable due to key storage problems. It can still be disabled with `resetOnError: false`
- Default key cipher changed to `RSA_ECB_OAEPwithSHA_256andMGF1Padding`
- Default storage cipher changed to `AES_GCM_NoPadding`
- Minimum Android SDK changed from 19 to 23
- Target SDK updated to 36
- Migrated from deprecated Jetpack Crypto library to custom cipher implementation (Tink doesn't support biometrics)
- Migrated to Java Version 17

**New Features:**
- New named constructors: `AndroidOptions()`, `AndroidOptions.biometric()`
- `AndroidOptions().migrateOnAlgorithmChange` automatically migrates data to new ciphers when enabled
- Improved biometric authentication with graceful degradation when device has no security setup
- Migration tools for transitioning from deprecated encryptedSharedPreferences
- Enhanced error handling with proper exception messages for biometric unavailability

**Fixes:**
- Fixed biometric authentication on devices without security (PIN/pattern/password) - now gracefully degrades when `enforceBiometrics=false`
- Fixed storage cipher and key cipher pairing validation
- Fixed migration checks for encrypted shared preferences
- Fixed biometric permission handling
- Fixed exception when reading data after boot

**Other Changes:**
- Updated Gradle, Kotlin, and Tink dependencies
- Refactored custom cipher implementations for better maintainability
- Added delete key functions for proper reset handling
- Migrated to new analyzer and code cleanup

### iOS / macOS (darwin)

## 10.0.0-beta.5
Due to security issues regarding the handling of biometrics in v10.0.0-beta.4, together with the deprecation
of Jetpack Security library, it took me some time to find a secure alternative. My apologies for the delay.

The Android part has been largely rewritten, reintroducing the customer cipher construction from before,
but with secure ciphers, biometrics support, updated default ciphers and migration tools.

**Breaking Changes:**
- `AndroidOptions().encryptedSharedPreferences` is now deprecated due to Jetpack Crypto package being deprecated
  For now you can still use deprecated encryptedSharedPreferences by setting `encryptedSharedPreferences: true` 
  and `migrateOnAlgorithmChange: false`. If `encryptedSharedPreferences` is `true` and `migrateOnAlgorithmChange`
  is `true`, data will be automatically migrated to the new cipher, and encryptedSharedPreferences
  cannot be used anymore.
- Google recommends using Tink library, but Tink does not support biometrics, so custom ciphers have been reintroduced
- Default key cipher changed to `RSA_ECB_OAEPwithSHA_256andMGF1Padding`
- Default storage cipher changed to `AES_GCM_NoPadding`

**New Features:**
- New named constructors: `AndroidOptions()`, `AndroidOptions.biometric()`
- `AndroidOptions().migrateOnAlgorithmChange` automatically migrates data to new ciphers when enabled
- Improved biometric authentication with graceful degradation when device has no security setup
- Migration tools for transitioning from deprecated encryptedSharedPreferences
- Enhanced error handling with proper exception messages for biometric unavailability

**Key Fixes:**
- Fixed biometric authentication on devices without security (PIN/pattern/password) - now gracefully degrades when `enforceBiometrics=false`
- Fixed storage cipher and key cipher pairing validation
- Fixed migration checks for encrypted shared preferences
- Fixed biometric permission handling
- Fixed default `resetOnError` behavior (now defaults to `true`)

**Other Changes:**
- Target SDK 36
- Updated Gradle, Kotlin, and Tink dependencies
- Updated minimum SDK according to Flutter requirements
- Refactored custom cipher implementations for better maintainability
- Added delete key functions for proper reset handling
