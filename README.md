# flutter_secure_storage

### Breaking change for v5.1.0
IOSAccessibility has been renamed to KeychainAccessibility. This however hasn't been properly documented in the changelog.

### Important notice for Android and v5.0.0
When upgrading from 4.2.1 to 5.0.0 you can migrate to EncryptedSharedPreferences by
setting the encryptedSharedPreference parameter to true as explained below. This will automatically
migrate all preferences. This however can't be undone. If you try to disable encryptedSharedPreference
after this, you won't be able to read the values. You can only read those with encryptedSharedPreference
enabled.

### Important notice for Web
flutter_secure_storage only works on HTTPS or localhost environments. [Please see this issue for more information.](https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage/issues/320#issuecomment-976308930)


A Flutter plugin to store data in secure storage:

- [Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/keychainServConcepts/01introduction/introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000897-CH203-TP1) is used for iOS
- AES encryption is used for Android. AES secret key is encrypted with RSA and RSA key is stored in [KeyStore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html).   
  By default following algorithms are used for AES and secret key encryption: AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding and RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding  
  From Android 6 you can use newer, recommended algoritms:  
  AES/GCM/NoPadding and RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding  
  You can set them in Android options like so:
```dart
  AndroidOptions _getAndroidOptions() => const AndroidOptions(
         keyCipherAlgorithm: KeyCipherAlgorithm.RSA_ECB_OAEPwithSHA_256andMGF1Padding,
         storageCipherAlgorithm: StorageCipherAlgorithm.AES_GCM_NoPadding,
      );
```
On devices running Android with version less than 6, plugin will fall back to default implementation. You can change the algorithm, even if you already have some encrypted preferences - they will be re-encrypted using selected algorithms.
Choosing algorithm is irrelevant if you are using EncryptedSharedPreferences as described below.
- With v5.0.0 we can use [EncryptedSharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/topic/security/data) on Android by enabling it in the Android Options like so:
```dart
  AndroidOptions _getAndroidOptions() => const AndroidOptions(
  encryptedSharedPreferences: true,
);
```
For more information see the example app.
- [`libsecret`](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) is used for Linux.

_Note_ KeyStore was introduced in Android 4.3 (API level 18). The plugin wouldn't work for earlier versions.

## Platform Implementation

## Getting Started

If not present already, please call WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() in your main before you do anything with the MethodChannel. [Please see this issue  for more info.](https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage/issues/336)

```dart
import 'package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage.dart';

// Create storage
final storage = new FlutterSecureStorage();

// Read value
String value = await storage.read(key: key);

// Read all values
Map<String, String> allValues = await storage.readAll();

// Delete value
await storage.delete(key: key);

// Delete all
await storage.deleteAll();

// Write value
await storage.write(key: key, value: value);

```

This allows us to be able to fetch secure values while the app is backgrounded, by specifying first_unlock or first_unlock_this_device. The default if not specified is unlocked.
An example:

```dart
final options = IOSOptions(accessibility: KeychainAccessibility.first_unlock);
await storage.write(key: key, value: value, iOptions: options);
```

### Configure Android version

In `[project]/android/app/build.gradle` set `minSdkVersion` to >= 18.

```
android {
    ...

    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 18
        ...
    }

}
```

_Note_ By default Android backups data on Google Drive. It can cause exception java.security.InvalidKeyException:Failed to unwrap key.
You need to

- [disable autobackup](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup#EnablingAutoBackup), [details](https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage/issues/13#issuecomment-421083742)
- [exclude sharedprefs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup#IncludingFiles) `FlutterSecureStorage` used by the plugin, [details](https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage/issues/43#issuecomment-471642126)

### Configure Web Version

Flutter Secure Storage uses an experimental implementation using WebCrypto. Use at your own risk at this time. Feedback welcome to improve it. The intent is that the browser is creating the private key, and as a result, the encrypted strings in local_storage are not portable to other browsers or other machines and will only work on the same domain.

**It is VERY important that you have HTTP Strict Forward Secrecy enabled and the proper headers applied to your responses or you could be subject to a javascript hijack.**

- https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/http-security-headers/

### Configure Linux Version

You need `libsecret-1-dev` and `libjsoncpp-dev` on your machine to build the project, and `libsecret-1-0` and `libjsoncpp1` to run the application (add it as a dependency after packaging your app). If you using snapcraft to build the project use the following

```yaml
parts:
  uet-lms:
    source: .
    plugin: flutter
    flutter-target: lib/main.dart
    build-packages:
      - libsecret-1-dev
      - libjsoncpp-dev
    stage-packages:
      - libsecret-1-dev
      - libjsoncpp-dev
```

### Configure MacOS Version

You also need to add Keychain Sharing as capability to your macOS runner. To achieve this, please add the following in *both* your `macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements` *and* `macos/Runner/Release.entitlements` (you need to change both files).

```
<key>keychain-access-groups</key>
<array/>
```

### Configure Windows Version

You need the C++ ATL libraries installed along with the rest of Visual Studio Build Tools. Download them from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools) and make sure the C++ ATL under optional is installed as well.

## Integration Tests

Run the following command from `example` directory

```
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
```
