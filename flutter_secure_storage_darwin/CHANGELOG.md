## [0.4.3](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/compare/flutter_secure_storage_darwin-v0.4.2...flutter_secure_storage_darwin-v0.4.3) (2026-09-15)


### Bug Fixes

* **darwin:** find keychain items across accessibility levels ([#1269](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/issues/1269)) ([9ae0e42](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/commit/9ae0e422d6ad6376ddf7960186d42342b0370baf))

## [0.4.2](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/compare/flutter_secure_storage_darwin-v0.4.1...flutter_secure_storage_darwin-v0.4.2) (2026-09-11)


### Bug Fixes

* **darwin:** skip synchronizable keychain queries when the data protection keychain is off ([0606cb4](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/commit/0606cb4e6cfa04dca440b7d3208e2aec2278f1a3))

## 0.4.1
- Fixed items written by versions prior to 0.3.0 becoming unreadable (and subsequent writes failing with `errSecDuplicateItem`) when no `accessControlFlags` are set. The 0.3.0 fix for `kSecAttrSynchronizable` being dropped caused `read`, `readAll` and `containsKey` to stop querying the legacy `kSecAttrAccessControl` storage envelope that those items were written under; they now fall back to it automatically. ([#1158](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/issues/1158))

## 0.4.0
- Raised minimum iOS deployment target from 12.0 to 13.0 to fix Swift compiler errors when building with Swift Package Manager. CryptoKit (used for Secure Enclave support) requires iOS 13.0+.

## 0.3.2
- Fixed `secStoreAvailabilitySink` not being called when protected data availability changes.
- Fixed `kSecUseDataProtectionKeychain` being added to Keychain queries unconditionally; it is now only set when `useDataProtectionKeychain` is explicitly enabled.

## 0.3.1
- Fixed iOS build by updating availability annotation for Secure Enclave methods from `iOS 11.3` to `iOS 13.0`.

## 0.3.0
- Added `useSecureEnclave` support for iOS and macOS to store encryption keys in the device's Secure Enclave for hardware-backed security.
- Use shared `LAContext` to reuse biometric authentication across Secure Enclave operations, avoiding double authentication prompts.
- Secure Enclave keys now use hardcoded `.privateKeyUsage` access control, preventing "ACL operation is not allowed" errors.

**Fixes:**
- Fixed `kSecAttrSynchronizable` being silently dropped when no access control flags are set.
- Fixed `readAll` to correctly return Secure Enclave items.
- Fixed macOS options keys alignment with iOS options.
- Added plain-text fallback when a Secure Enclave wrapped key is missing.

## 0.2.0
- Remove keys regardless of synchronizable state or accessibility constraints.

## 0.1.1
 - Fix warnings with Privacy Manifest

## 0.1.0
This package combines flutter_secure_storage_macos together with the ios part of flutter_secure_storage.

Other changes:
- Code has been rebuild from the ground up
- Lots of missing attributes have been added to the IOSOptions and MacOsOptions classes.
